Checking What’s Installed
	
	You can see a list of all your installed packages with dpkg.
		    sudo dpkg –list

	You can also use less to scroll through this list.
			    sudo dpkg –list | less
	You can also search through the list with the grep command.
			    dpkg –list | grep [search term]
	
	If something is installed, you’ll see a package name and a 		description.

	You can also search through a more compact method:

    			dpkg –l ‘search term’
